Do you travel frequently? Do you book stays, flights, cars, buses and trains? Are you frustrated by trying to keep track of all of your travel arrangements by sifting through your email and the different travel providers’ apps? 
The Road Warrior offers a single point of truth for all your travel arrangements. Hotels, cars, flights, trains, buses, all arranged into a simple trip-centred interface.
# Business Case
## Mission
To be the platform that frequent travellers and travel marketers rely on for accurate travel information.
## Problem statement
-	I can’t keep track of my travel reservations across emails and provider-specific apps. I worry that I will miss messages about checking in, delays or cancellations.
-	There are few ways to get a consolidated view of traveller information. Providers, marketers and researchers cannot easily piece together trends for end-to-end travel
## Non-Functional Requirements
-	Platform is expected to have 2 million active users / week with a total 15 million user accounts
o	On a weekly basis usage will most likely have peaks between Sunday-Monday and Thursday-Friday, as most of the customer base is expected to be business travel
o	Major travel disruptions such as storms and other large events will cause dramatic peaks in some areas of the software
-	The Road Warrior will monetize its data, which may mean large queries being run against its data.
-	Users must be able to access the system from around the world at all times
-	Updates to travel arrangements must be communicated to The Road Warrior users within 5 minutes after generation from the source
-	Our customers are very demanding for performance. First-contentful paint should occur under 1.4 seconds

# Assumptions
-	Travel bookings are made elsewhere. The app is used for managing/tracking/viewing
-	Road Warrior will not process payments for adjustments to bookings. Those will be handled by the Travel Agencies
-	Travel information will be from APOLLO and SABRE, via the open API provided by those systems, while problem resolution will be done via preferred travel agencies
-	“Preferred travel agency” means agencies that have established a relationship with Road Warrior and that provide an API for customer support
-	Data customers will access the data via API and this data does not need to be real-time
